Why use BibTerm2Dict?

- You want to annotate your maps or other graphics in the local language?
- You have a list of Biblical Terms in Paratext(http://pt8.paratext.org/) which contains most of the placenames and proper names you wish to use.
- Map Creator(http://www.fmosoft.com/) has most of the maps and graphics you want and can easily import more.
- While you could cut and paste between the two programs for one map, it would be much nicer to do all the maps and graphics in one go!
- Do you have simple rules for transliterating majority language place name into you local language? If so why type the names when the BibTerm2Dict could do it for you!
- If you don't have time to do everything in one go, BibTerm2Dict will remember what stage you're up to and carry on from where you left off!
- Collect the ifo you need to submit your language to the CLDR database, so that one day there will be a slot in MS Word and LO for your languages splelling dictionary.
BibTerm2Dictd can walk you through this process
